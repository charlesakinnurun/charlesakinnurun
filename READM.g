## 🧠 About Me
Hi — I’m **Charles Akinnurun**, currently working as a **Data Scientist (VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE) at British Airways**.  

<p>As a Data Scientist, AI/ML Engineer and an OSS Contributor that specializes in data science, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing ,  computer vision and artificial intelligence, with a proven record of building scalable, production-ready AI/ML systems that deliver quantifiable business and technical impact.</p>

<p>I have led and executed the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle across 140+ ML projects, spanning data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and optimization using Python (Scklit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R and SQL </p>

<p>Through systematic experimentation and hyperparameter tuning with XGBoost, LightGBM, and Catboost, I improved model performance by 38%–45%, reduced error rates by 27%–40%, and increased model stability across multiple deployment environments.
</p>

<p>My work includes regression, classification, clustering, association rule mining, dimensionality reduction, time-series forecasting, and real-time inference systems, supporting use cases such as prediction, recommendation, anomaly detection, and automation. </p>

</p>I bring a strong foundation in computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, probability, algorithms, and data structures, enabling me to design robust, efficient, and interpretable models at scale.</p>

<p>I design and manage scalable database systems supporting AI/ML workflows, working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite to build optimized schemas and high-performance queries. I have developed and maintained 50+ database-driven pipelines, reducing query latency by 35–60% through indexing, partitioning, and query optimization, while improving data processing efficiency by 40%. By implementing robust ETL/ELT workflows and automated data validation checks, I increased data reliability by 30% and ensured production-ready data infrastructure for large-scale machine learning and real-time inference systems.</p>

<p>I have implemented automated retraining workflows, established monitoring systems that detect data drift and performance degradation within 24 hours, and optimized pipelines for scalability and efficiency.</p>

<p>In addition to hands-on development, I actively contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams (engineering, product, analytics) across 25+ projects, and conduct continuous research on emerging trends in machine and deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, regularly shipping prototypes and proof-of-concepts to production-ready systems.</p>

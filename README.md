## 🧠 About Me
Hi — I’m **Charles Akinnurun**, currently working as a **Data Scientist (VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE) at British Airways**.  

<p>As a Data Scientist, AI/ML Engineer and an OSS Contributor that specializes in data science, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP),  computer vision and artificial intelligence, with a proven record of building scalable, production-ready machine learning systems that deliver quantifiable business and technical impact.</p>

<p>I have led and executed the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle across 140+ ML projects, spanning data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and optimization using Python (Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R, and SQL. </p>

<p>My work includes regression, classification, clustering, association rule mining, dimensionality reduction, time-series forecasting, and real-time inference systems, supporting use cases such as prediction, recommendation, anomaly detection, and automation. </p>

<p>Through systematic experimentation and hyperparameter tuning with XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, I improved model performance by 37%–45%, reduced error rates by 25–40%, and increased model stability across multiple deployment environments.</p>

<p>I bring a strong foundation in computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, probability, algorithms, and data structures, enabling me to design robust, efficient, and interpretable models at scale.</p>

<p>In addition to hands-on development, I actively contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams (engineering, product, analytics) across 25+ projects, and conduct continuous research on emerging trends in machine and deep learning, natual language processing, and computer vision, regularly shipping prototypes and proof-of-concepts to production-ready systems.</p>

## 🧠 About Me
Hi — I’m **Charles Akinnurun**, currently working as a **Data Scientist (VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE) at British Airways**.  

<p>As a Data Scientist, AI/ML Engineer, and Open-Source Contributor, I specialize in <b>data science, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and artificial intelligence</b>, with a proven track record of building scalable, production-ready AI/ML systems that deliver measurable business and technical impact.</p>

<p>I have led and executed the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle across <b>140+ ML projects</b>, spanning <b>data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, deployment</b>, monitoring, and optimization using <b>Python (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R, and SQL.</b> These projects processed datasets ranging from <b>100K to 10M+ records</b>, supporting batch and real-time inference systems serving <b>up to 5,000+ requests per minute.</b></p>

<p>Through systematic experimentation and advanced hyperparameter tuning <b>using XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost,</b> I improved model performance by <b>38%–45%,</b> reduced error rates by <b>27%–40%,</b> increased AUC scores from <b>0.71 to 0.89,</b> and reduced inference latency <b>by 30%,</b> enabling near real-time decision-making in production environments.</p>

<p>My work spans <b>regression, classification, clustering, association rule mining, dimensionality reduction</b>, time-series forecasting, and real-time inference systems. These models have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved regression model performance with <b>R² increased by 0.31, RMSE reduced by 22%, MAE reduced by 19%, and MAPE reduced by 17%.</b></li>
<li>Increased prediction <b>accuracy by up to 42%, improving F1-Score by 0.29, Recall by 18%, and ROC-AUC by 0.21.</b></li>
<li>Increased <b>Precision by 24%</b> while reducing <b>False Positive Rate (FPR) by 21%.</b></li>
<li>Boosted <b>ROC-AUC by 0.21 and PR-AUC by 0.19,</b> strengthening class discrimination performance.</li>
<li>Reduced <b>Davies–Bouldin Index by 22%,</b> demonstrating better cluster compactness and separation.</li>
<li>Increased <b>Calinski–Harabasz Index by 31%,</b> reflecting improved cluster structure and variance ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p>I bring a strong foundation in <b>computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, probability, data structures and algorithms,</b> enabling me to design robust, scalable, and interpretable systems handling multi-terabyte datasets and distributed workloads.</p>

<p>I design and manage scalable database systems supporting AI/ML workflows using <b>PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite,</b> building optimized schemas and high-performance queries. I have <b>developed and maintained 50+</b> database-driven pipelines, reducing query latency by <b>35–60%,</b> improving data processing throughput by <b>40–55%,</b> and lowering infrastructure costs <b>by 20% through indexing, partitioning, caching, and query optimization.</b></p>

<p>By implementing robust <b>ETL/ELT pipelines,</b> automated validation checks, and data quality monitoring systems, I increased data <b>reliability by 30–45%,</b> reduced pipeline <b>failures by 50%,</b> and <b>ensured 99%+ data consistency</b> across production environments.</p>

<p>I have implemented automated retraining workflows that reduced manual intervention <b>by 70%,</b> established monitoring systems detecting data drift and model degradation <b>within 24 hours,</b> and <b>reduced model downtime by 60%</b>, maintaining SLA compliance <b>above 95%.</b></p>

<p>In addition to hands-on development, I actively contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams (engineering, product, analytics) <b>across 25+ projects,</b> accelerate experimentation cycles <b>by 35%,</b> and regularly transform research prototypes into production-ready systems <b>within 2–4 weeks,</b> reducing time-to-deployment <b>by 40%.</b></p>
